  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <h3><u>Education</u></h3>
  <ul>
    <li>BA Environmental Studies: Politics, Culture, and Society | Magna Cum Laude | Pacific University</li>
    <li>Data Analytics Bootcamp | University of Oregon/Trilogy Education Services</li>
  </ul>

  <h3><u>Professional</u></h3>
  <p>Since graduating from Pacific University in 2018, I have worked on several nonpartisan and Democratic campaigns including:</p>

  </ul>

  <h3><u>Personal</u></h3>
  <p>Based on my professional experience, you may have ascertained that I am interested in US Politics. I think it is important 
    to keep up with the news and understand what's going on in the world. More than that, though, I enjoy looking at political processes 
    and outcomes with a <a href=https://medium.com/disruptive-design/tools-for-systems-thinkers-the-6-fundamental-concepts-of-systems-thinking-379cdac3dc6a'>systems thinking</a> lens, 
    considering history, political parties, media, and incentive structures. Understanding these concepts can, I think, drive positive change.</p>
