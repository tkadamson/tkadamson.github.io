  <h2>About Me:</h2>

  <h3><u>Personal</u></h3>
  <p>Based on my professional experience, you may have ascertained that I am interested in US Politics. I think it is important 
    to keep up with the news and understand what's going on in the world. More than that, though, I enjoy looking at political processes 
    and outcomes with a <a href=https://medium.com/disruptive-design/tools-for-systems-thinkers-the-6-fundamental-concepts-of-systems-thinking-379cdac3dc6a'>systems thinking</a> lens, 
    considering history, political parties, media, and incentive structures. Understanding these concepts can, I think, drive positive change.</p>

  <p>But it's not all politics all the time! I also enjoy reading fiction and non-fiction, various television shows (see recs below), games on
     my Nintendo Switch, and board games with friends (though not so much lately with the pandemic). I'm also an amateur cook (my family lets me 
    make our HelloFresh boxes) and I enjoy gardening/yardwork projects.</p>
  
  <p>Lastly, I'm a big music person. In High School and College, I played trumpet in concert bands, and I also participated in my high school's 
    marching band and winter drumline programs. I've performed in several community musicals going back to my teenage years, and I particularly 
    enjoy Sondheim's "Into the Woods." I still follow Drum Corps International (DCI) performances, and I have a large collection of DCI music and
    videos. My favorie concert band piece is <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQulSzsCMxs>Shepard's Hay </a> by Percy Granger</p>
